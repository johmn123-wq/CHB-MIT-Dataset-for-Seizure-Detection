<h1 align = 'center'> Seizure Detection using Reinforcement Learning</h1>

 - A project based on detecting Seizure and Non-seizure person using Deep Reinforcement Learning approach

## About the Project

- Here, The task was to classify the ictal(seizure) and non-ictal(seizure-free) patients using pucblicly available standard CHB-MIT dataset.First I extracted the dataset into havinng 71 Non-Seizure and 71 Seizure text files for all the 23 patients.
